# My Portfolio Project
## This project is old, the ideal would be to redo it, but as I'm out of time and I want to keep it running, I just did a little refactoring using tailwindcss
I intend to build my portfolio simply using react + typescript. <br/>
Boostrap theme used: [Pulse](https://bootswatch.com/pulse/) <br/>
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) using typescript template.
